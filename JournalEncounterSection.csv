"11680","Overview","Two portals dominate Xhul'horac's room: one powered by void, and one by the Legion's fel magic. Xhul'horac activates the Fel portal first, granting him fel abilities and summoning first Imps and then Vanguard Akkelion. 

When Akkelion dies, Xhul'horac activates the void portal, granting him void abilities and summoning Unstable Voidfiends and then Omnus.

Once Omnus is defeated, Xhul'horac gains the energy of both fel and void, rapidly switching between elements. Once he reaches 20% health, he completely absorbs the power of both portals and must be quickly defeated.","0","0","0","1447","11701","11681","0","0","0","1","3","-1"

"13107","Overview","Gul'dan begins a ritual to bring his master into Azeroth, locking himself inside the active Eye of Aman'Thul and summoning his demonic lieutenants. However, proximity to the active Eye of Aman'Thul bestows equally powerful abilities to players, based on their role.

After his lieutenants fall, Gul'dan leaps into the fray himself, harnessing the power of the Fel to bolster his frail frame. At 85%, 70%, and 55% health, Gul'dan again taps into the active Eye of Aman'Thul, empowering his abilities.

As his health dwindles further, Gul'dan beseeches his Legion masters for additional power, unleashing his ultimate strength while disrupting the aid that players receive from the Eye.","0","0","0","1737","13111","13108","0","1","0","1","3","-1"

"13998","Overview","Odyn challenges players to prove their worth before delving into Helheim to face Helya. Players begin the encounter facing Hymdall and Hyrja. After bringing both Hymdall and Hyrja to 25% health before they can cast |cFF2959D3|Hspell: 228171|h[Revivify]|h|r, Odyn leaps into battle.

At 55% health remaining, Odyn shows his true power and begins to fill the room with |cFF2959D3|Hspell: 227475|h[Cleansing Flame]|h|r. When Odyn reaches 10% health, he is satisfied with your martial prowess, and allows you to become his champions in the fight against Helya.","0","0","0","1819","14002","13999","0","0","0","1","3","-1"
